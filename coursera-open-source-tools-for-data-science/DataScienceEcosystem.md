Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples

### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python


```python
2+2
```




    4




```python
2**3
```




    8




```python
import math
math.sqrt(4)
```




    2.0



Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers


```python
# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5
```




    17



Exercise 9 - Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours


```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

def convertmm2hh(mm):
    return round(mm/60,1)

mm = 200
print('mm:',mm,'hh:',convertmm2hh(mm))
```

    mm: 200 hh: 3.3
